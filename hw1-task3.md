3. Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests.
Are there any difference with run on emulator?

---Connection with real telephone is slower (!!! time for connection to Samsung GT-N7100 (Android 4.4.4) is slower
than Samsung GT-I9100 (Android 4.1.2) and faster than Samsung SM-N9005 (Android 6.0)).

!!!I don`t know why, but the id locator can`t working with elder Samsung GT-I9100 (android 4.1.2).
